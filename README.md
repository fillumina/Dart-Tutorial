# Dart Tutorial

This tutorial is thought for coders that want to learn fast or just review the Dart language. There are a series of dart source files that explain various axpects of the language in a progressive, easy to understad way. The beauty of it is that if you are reading them directly on your IDE you can run, modify and experiment with them improving substantially your learning speed.

Because learning is subjective and depends on previous knowledge feel free to send me suggestions and improvements to help people learn fast.
